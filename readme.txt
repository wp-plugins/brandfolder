### Features of the Brandfolder WordPress plugin

* Edit your Brandfolder directly from your WordPress admin panel.
* Designate links to your Brandfolder with the class name 'Brandfolder' and you'll quickly have the embed popup working.
* Embed your interactive Brandfolder inside a Page or Post using the [Brandfolder] shortcode (make sure you have added your unique brandfoler URL before doing so). See an example of at <a href="http://about.mapmyfitness.com/brand" target="_blank">MapMyFitness Brand Assets</a>.
* Shortcodes available: [Brandfolder], [Brandfolder-press], [Brandfolder-people], [Brandfolder-logos], [Brandfolder-documents], and [Brandfolder-images] to pull in content using our Widget API. Read more about that at <a href="https://api.brandfolder.com">api.brandfolder.com</a>.
